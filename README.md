# Find me on GitLab!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello!
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have switched from hosting my repositories on GitHub to GitLab as of late. The perks of free private repositories works well for me at the moment, and I prefer to have all of my repositories hosted in the same place. In the future, I plan to host my repositories on my own server, but until then I am satisfied with the change. If there are any questions or comments, please feel free to send me an email! I will see you on the other side!
